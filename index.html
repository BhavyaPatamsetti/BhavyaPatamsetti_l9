      This website consists of a game.It's a memory game though.Which has a time
      limit of 100 seconds. In which you need to match cards.You will have to
      complete this within 100 seconds time limit. If you complete it you will
      find a pop-up with "VICTORY". If you lose you will need to replay. This is
      a simple game though.<br />
      <br />
